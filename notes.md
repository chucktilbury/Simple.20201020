This is a rough sketch of my todo list in this project.

* Connect error module to the configure module for verbosity.
* Implement initializing lists and dicts.
* Implement compound symbols.
* ~~Implement includes.~~
* ~~Fix the bug where function call output parameters can be a constant value.~~
* ~~get rid of the need for empty parens after class symbol.~~
* ~~casts are broken~~ Casts no longer make sense because there is only one kind of number.
